# How to contribute to FigureForge
I am grateful for your interest in contributing to FigureForge. This page provides you with some information on how to get involved.

## Adding a feature to FigureForge
I am using [this](https://github.com/users/nogula/projects/3) Kanban board to track the features I plan to implement. Mostly they are there so I don't forget. If you want to implement a feature, please start by add a [Feature Request](https://github.com/nogula/FigureForge/issues/new?assignees=nogula&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=) issue and assigning yourself to it or leave a comment on it. This will let me know that you are working on it. Then, please fork this repository, commit your changes, and create a pull request.

### Setting up your development environment
1. Clone the repository with:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/nogula/FigureForge.git
   ```
2. Install poetry:
   ```
   pip install poetry
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   poetry install
   ```

### Pull requests
At this point, I don't have a template for pull requests. Everything is kinda ad hoc till the (lack of) organization becomes unbearable. So just do what you think is best, I guess. I'm open to suggestions, though!

## Contibuting to documentation
The documentation for FigureForge is available on the GitHub [wiki](https://github.com/nogula/FigureForge/wiki). Editing access is restricted to Collaborators only. If you would like to help out, thank you. Please send @nogula a note or otherwise add a discussion item [here](https://github.com/nogula/FigureForge/discussions/categories/general).
