## Help
This project's wiki will host the documentation, but it hasn't been written yet... in the meantime, check out the [FAQ & Troubleshooting](https://github.com/nogula/FigureForge/wiki/FAQ-&-Troubleshooting) page, create a [new issue](https://github.com/nogula/FigureForge/issues), or ask a question in the [discussions](https://github.com/nogula/FigureForge/discussions/1).

## Contributing
Obviously, FigureForge is still early in development (no releases have been made yet). Correspondingly, there are many opportunities to implement features and fix bugs. If you want to pitch in, you are welcome to fork the project and make a pull request.

Truth be told, I am an aerospace engineer and not a software developer; I don't know how to develop professional software, but am doing my best - especially because FigureForge is solving one of my own problems. If you would like to contribute, I would be grateful. There is no roadmap, there are no planned features except those which I think I can work out in the next week or so, and there is no formal development software. But maybe you can help with that!
